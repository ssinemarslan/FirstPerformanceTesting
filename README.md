This is my first run of performance testing processes with Jmeter.
A test was conducted on the "Medium.com/membership" site with the request to run the test 5 times with 100 users. And the site gives the "429 Too Many Requests" error.
I made this project with the help of "Ozan Eser", a writer on the "medium" website.
